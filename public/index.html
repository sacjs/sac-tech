            Need Help?

            You have our contact details in the Slack Team Directory

            The Quick Version
          </h2>

          <p>
            Our Slack group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
            communication experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender
            identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
            physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
            We do not tolerate harassment of Slack participants in any form.
            Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference
            venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online
            media. Slack participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
            expelled from the Slack group at the discretion of the Slack group
            organisers.
          </p>

          <h2>
            The Less Quick Version
          </h2>

          <p>
            Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender
            identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
            physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images,
            deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of channels
            or other mediums, and unwelcome sexual attention.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
            particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or
            other material. Slack staff (including volunteers) should not use
            sexualised content or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Slack group
            organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
            warning the offender or expulsion from the Slack group.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
            harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the
            Slack group staff immediately. Slack group staff can be identified
            through the Team Directory.
          </p>

          <p>
            Slack group staff will be happy to help participants contact local
            law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
            feel safe for the duration of their time in our Slack group. We value
            your contribution.
